# :pushpin: This is my Academic year project for the subject "Fundamentals of Algorithmization and Programming" (First year of university)

:notebook: This program is an assistant in the calculation of matrix expressions.

:computer: I use __Delphi 7__ to write code.

### What can it do :question:

- It can multiply matrices.

- The program can also add and subtract matrices.
- It can multiply the matrix by a number.
- Transpose a matrix.
- Find the inverse matrix.
- Turn the matrix to a triangular form.
- Find the determinant of the matrix.
- And it is also possible to calculate any matrix expression.
- You can use the calculation history for further calculations.
